This is created to deploy graylog along with Mongo db and elastic search in a dockerized environment.

I have used Rancher server to do this.

Steps.

1) Copy/ Download the docker-compose.yml file.
2) Edit the ElasticHostIP in the file to 127.0.0.1 if you are deploying via docker. 
    If using rancher, you need to give the hostIP. I am not yet sure how to pick host IP dynamically. Will uppdate if i get to know.
3) Go to Rancher Server -> Add new Stack - > Paste the contents / upload the docker-compose.yml file and click create.

You should see the Graylog up and running at 9000 port.
